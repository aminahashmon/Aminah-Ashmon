    <p>
I am a Senior at Western Michigan Universityâ€™s Haworth College of Business studying human resource management. I am a dedicated student with a passion for labor relations, negotiations, and training. 
I am a mentor and a member of Phi Chi Theta Business Fraternity. I enjoy offering insight to other students about the business world, and Human Resources. I am also a member of the Society for Excellence in Human Resources, where we host networking events all about HR.

    <p> 
As a student from Detroit, MI, it is very important for me to prove myself in college, and stand out both socially and academically. I want to be able to ispire othr youth from Detroit to aim higher, and push themselves. In the near future, after I graduate from Western, I plan to move to Texas to pursue a career in HR and Real Estate. I am currently working on my realtor's liscence and I plan to be a real estate investor for commercial and residential properties.
I want to be able to give back to my local community, and mentor students as well.
